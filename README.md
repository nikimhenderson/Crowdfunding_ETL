# Crowdfunding_ETL
This repo contains the project 2 crowdfunding database

In order to create the database, use the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql.
For reference we used the Crowdfunding_ERD.png to create the schema.
The code for creating the csv files (campaign.csv, contacts.csv, category.csv and subcategory.csv) is contained in the ETL_Mini_Project_BRoybal_NHenderson.ipynb.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
